# Octopus Problems
- Representing different Big-O notations with a very hungery octopus!

## A Very Hungry Octopus wants to eat the longest fish in an array of fish.

```Ruby
['fish', 'fiiish', 'fiiiiish', 'fiiiish', 'fffish', 'ffiiiiisshh', 'fsh', 'fiiiissshhhhhh']
=> "fiiiissshhhhhh"
```
## Sluggish Octopus
- Find the longest fish in O(n^2) time. Do this by comparing all fish lengths to all other fish lengths

## Dominant Octopus
- Find the longest fish in O(n log n) time. Hint: You saw a sorting algorithm that runs in O(n log n) in the Sorting Complexity Demo. Remember that Big O is classified by the dominant term.

## Clever Octopus
- Find the longest fish in O(n) time. The octopus can hold on to the longest fish that you have found so far while stepping through the array only once.
